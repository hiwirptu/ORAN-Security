**Architecture-related Risks for 5G/6G Security**

The architecture components and associated risks in 5G (and prospective 6G) are as follows:

1. **Service-Based Architecture (SBA):** Decomposed, virtualized, and distributed network functions pose challenges for network security as the independence of network functions from infrastructure can lead to vulnerabilities.

2. **Application Programming Interfaces (API):** Poorly encrypted or inadequately secured APIs can jeopardize network resources, making them susceptible to attacks.

3. **Private and Corporate 5G Networks:** If not adequately protected, these networks can become sources of attacks for the network segments they are connected to, compromising overall network security.

4. **Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC):** Security management becomes challenging in decentralized information processing, such as edge computing, as significant network parts can be vulnerable to attacks from various locations.

5. **Radio Access Network (RAN) and Open-RAN:** The inherent exposure of the radio segment to attacks related to the transmission medium poses significant security challenges. Additionally, the open specification of the radio interface (O-RAN) introduced in the 5G network raises concerns about the security of O-RAN applications, particularly in the physical or MAC layer.

The first three issues are akin to general software architecture and application security problems, while the last two specifically address RAN and its novel features, including openness and intelligence.

**Signaling Storm**

In detecting a Signaling Storm attack, KPI profiles are crucial. These profiles, generated in Near-RT RIC and updated dynamically, capture statistics of network access requests and Timing Advance (TA) parameters of each User Equipment (UE), particularly applicable to IoT devices. Anomaly values are calculated based on these profiles and the observed number of access requests, using a weighted version of the DBSCAN grouping algorithm. The algorithm determines the presence or absence of a Signaling Storm attack and approximates the adversary's distance from the gNodeB (E2 Node). An increased number of Msg2: Random Access Response messages containing the same TA parameter measured by the gNodeB (E2 Node) indicates adversary UEs. Connection requests associated with a given TA may be rejected.

The detection process comprises two phases: the training phase and the inference phase. In the training phase, KPI profiles are built based on Random Access responses forwarded to Near-RT RIC from the gNodeB via the E2 interface. Parameters of the detection algorithm, such as the anomaly metric threshold, are adjusted during this phase. In the inference phase, detection occurs at the access network level, requiring the collection of Msg2 messages for a period corresponding to the KPI profile validity. If adversary activity is detected, the xApp utilizes the E2 interface to notify the gNodeB (E2 Node) to reject connection requests from the identified UE, halting UE authentication within the core network.
