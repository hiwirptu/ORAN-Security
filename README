Open RAN is a recent trend in the telecommunications market (especially in the 5G area), aiming at the realization of the following key objectives:

    splitting of a base station into several functional components, including central unit (CU), distributed unit (DU), and a remote unit (RU);
    opening interfaces to enable interoperability (especially Open Fronthaul);
    disaggregating software from hardware in the RAN domain;
    introducing advanced automation into the RAN system by means of an abstracted entity to manage the radio networks, i.e. RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) which serves as a platform for xApps (optimization applications in the RAN domain) and rApps (optimization applications in the management plane) using AI/ML.
